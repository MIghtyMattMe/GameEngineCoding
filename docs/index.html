<h1>Welcome to Smol Game Engine!</h1>
<p1>This is a personal project by Matthew Meacham that uses 
    Dear IMGUI, SDL3, and Box2D to create a small 2D game 
    engine. The purpose of this project is to experiment with 
    building a game engine from the ground up. The Smol Game 
    Engine is not meant for commercial use, however if anyone 
    wants to utilize this they are free to do so.
</p1>
<br></br>
<h2>How do I use the engine?</h2>
<p1>Upon opening the engine, there are 3 different windows; the Control Board, Engine Tools, and Inspector.</p1>
<br></br>
<p1>Click on the respective links to learn more about each one:</p1>
<br></br>
<p1>The Control Board</p1>
<br></br>
<p1>The Engine Tools</p1>
<br></br>
<p1>The Inspector</p1>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<p1>Smol Game Engine also utilizes it's own custom scripting language. These are known as Update Scripts and get called every "frame" of play. These scripts are written as simple txt files.</p1>
