<h1>Welcome to Smol Game Engine!</h1>
<p1>This is a personal project by Matthew Meacham that uses 
    Dear IMGUI, SDL3, and Box2D to create a small 2D game 
    engine. <br>The purpose of this project is to experiment with 
    building a game engine from the ground up. The Smol Game 
    Engine is <br>not meant for commercial use, however if anyone 
    wants to utilize this they are free to do so.
</p1>
<br></br>
<h2>How do I use the engine?</h2>
<p1>Upon opening the engine, there are 3 different windows; the Control Board, Engine Tools, and Inspector.</p1>
<br></br>
<p1>Click on the respective links to learn more about each one:</p1>
<br></br>
<p1><a href="./HowToUse.html#control">The Control Board</a></p1>
<br></br>
<p1><a href="./HowToUse.html#tools">The Engine Tools</a></p1>
<br></br>
<p1><a href="HowToUse.html#inspect">The Inspector</a></p1>
<br></br>
<p1>To place objects in the game world, first left-click on an object button in the Engine Tools window.<br>
    Then, left click anywhere in the game world to place it. If you want to edit the object's properties,<br>
    right-click on the object to open it's properties in the Inspector window. Edit the various properties there.<br>
    Save and load a project using the Control Board window.<br>
    Use middle mouse to move the camera in the editor.
</p1>
<br></br>
<p1>Smol Game Engine also utilizes it's own custom scripting language. These are known as Update Scripts and <br>
    get called every "frame" of play. These scripts are written as simple txt files.</p1>
<br></br>
